    /*
        Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

        The lower bound algorithm finds the first and smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

        If no such index is found, return the size of the array.

        Example 1

        Input : nums= [1,2,2,3], x = 2

        Output:1

        Explanation:

        Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.

        Example 2

        Input : nums= [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9

        Output: 3

        Explanation:

        Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.

        Time complexity O(logN)
        space complexity O(1)
