    /*
        Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

        The upper bound of x is defined as the smallest index i such that nums[i] > x.

        If no such index is found, return the size of the array.

        Example 1

        Input : n= 4, nums = [1,2,2,3], x = 2

        Output:3

        Explanation:

        Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

        Example 2

        Input : n = 5, nums = [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9

        Output: 3

        Explanation:

        Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

        Time compexity: O(log N)
        Space compexity O(1)
